# API

This section documents the web API used between the GUI and the "frontend" webserver.

The bulk of the API is RESTful. The exception to this rule is the searching API which uses websockets due to the nature of data exchange and transfer involved in launching and observing data from a search.

## Test API

The System contains a test API located at _/api/test_ which can be used to test if the webserver is alive and functioning.  The test API is entirely unauthenticated and always responds with a StatusOK 200 and an empty body.
