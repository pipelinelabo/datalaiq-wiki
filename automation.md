# Automation

DatalaiQ provides several utilities to enable automated operations. At the most basic level, users can schedule searches to be executed at specific times, for example every morning at 1:00. They can also schedule flows and scripts, which can execute multiple searches, sift and parse search results, and send notifications via email or HTTP. Flows are designed using a drag-and-drop graphical interface and are generally preferred over scripts, which should be reserved for legacy situations or very particular use cases that flows cannot cover.
