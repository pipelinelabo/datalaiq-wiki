# Changelog for version 3.3.13

### Released May 28 2020

## Backend Changes
* The syslog module now properly parses 32-bit PIDs.
* Fixed [a bug in a dependency](https://github.com/peterbourgon/diskv/issues/40) which could cause a panic in the resource system.

## Webserver Changes
* Systems using Community Edition licenses are now allowed only two user accounts.
* Refined the HTTP status codes we return for various different login failure states.

## Ingester Changes
* Ingesters, and all other open-source code, are now managed in the [github.com/gravwell/gravwell](https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell) monorepo.
* Ingesters were not shipping the crash-report binary; split crash reporter into its own gravwell-crash-reporter package on Redhat and Debian and made all packages depend on it.
* Fixed a concurrent map read/write error in the Kinesis ingester.
