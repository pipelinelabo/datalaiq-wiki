# Changelog for version 4.0.0

### Released July 28 2020

## Web UI Changes
* Implemented Gravwell Kits user interface: browse, install, and update kits containing pre-built analysis tools such as dashboards, actionables, and templates
* Implemented actionables, which help pivot from search results--just click or highlight text in the results for a menu of possible actions
* Implemented search templates, stored queries containing variables (such as an IP address) to set at search time
* Re-organized main menu makes navigation less cluttered
* Added experimental search studio feature
* Major improvements to scheduled script development and testing workflow
* Dashboard tiles can now be temporarily "maximized" to view data more comfortably
* Map renderers now include tables listing locations and the metadata associated with them
* Favorites and kits are now easily accessible from the home page
* Faster-loading dashboards with grid customization

## Backend Changes
* Implemented Gravwell Kits
* Added wildcard support to well tag specifications
* Added transparent compression to ingest streams
* Implemented more efficient B-tree indexing system (more effective for extremely large indexes)
* Added `maclookup` module to look up MAC address vendors
* Added `getMacro` function for anko scripts
* Exposed `github.com/RackSec/srslog` to anko scripts, allowing scripts to send syslog messages
* Exposed `encoding/base64`, `encoding/xml`, and `encoding/hex` packages to anko scripts
* Added duration filtering and extraction for netflow and ipfix modules
* Improved autoextractor behavior in multi-tag queries with disjoint field sets
* Improved webserverâ†’indexer ingest functionality (entries are now ingested in parallel rather than blocking the control port)
* Improved recovery for corrupted shards & indexes
* Added `Max-Log-Files` configuration option to limit the number of log files in `/opt/gravwell/log`
* `stats` module now properly handles TAG, e.g. `tag=* stats unique_count(TAG) as foo | gauge foo`
* Improved handling of search deletion (admin users were unable to delete other users' ACTIVE/SAVED searches)
* `syslog` module will no longer drop entries which it fails to parse as syslog entries (matching the behavior of other extraction modules)
* Fixed bug where entries could come back with entry DATA fields during a replication hot-failover scenario
* Fixed bug where a query containing a macro immediately followed by a newline would fail to parse
* Fixed error where an improperly shut-down indexer could cause replication failures
* Fixed issue where an error in the renderer module would be marked as originating from a different module instead
* Fixed incorrect time reversal behavior of sort module in certain cases
* Fixed off-by-one error in query tag handling which could cause crashes
* Fixed bug in macro creation in which groups were not properly preserved
* Fixed SSO bug where user removal from a group in Active Directory was not mirrored in Gravwell
* Fixed incorrect nil pointer handling in scheduled search `httpPost` function
* Fixed potential webserver crash during shutdown due to lingering websockets
* Fixed bug where `gauge` module could not parse multiple `(magnitude label)` specifications
* Fixed bug in `gauge` module where enumerated values containing underscores were not parsed correctly

## Ingesters & Ingest Library Changes
* Implemented new, more efficient cache system, including new cache mode which allows ingestion without any active indexer connections
* Added preprocessor to handle Amazon VPC flow logs
* Fixed bug where cached entries could fail tag translation on ingester restart
* Kinesis ingester now reports metrics via `gravwell` tag
* Kafka Federator now supports TLS-encrypted Kafka transports
* Fixed line number reporting on ingester log messages
* Improved logging in early ingester startup
* Added code to handle Zeek's tendency to leak PIDs
* Added transparent compression to ingest library
* Implemented new `gravwellforward` preprocessor which can duplicate entries to other Gravwell indexers

## Kits
* Network Enrichment: Provides databases for enriching network data (geoip, ASN, IP protocols, etc.)
* CoreDNS: Analyze entries from the [Gravwell CoreDNS plugin](https://github.com/gravwell/coredns)
* Netflow v5: Analyze Netflow v5 flow records
* IPFIX: Analyze IPFIX flow records
* Grok: Pre-built database of extraction patterns for use with the [grok module](#!search/grok/grok.md)
* Weather: Track weather conditions over time
* Coming soon: Zeek, Windows, Sysmon, and syslog kits

## General/Miscellaneous
* Added Debian and RPM packages for datastore and loadbalancer components
* Migrated some personally-maintained code forks into github.com/gravwell umbrella account
* Transitioned most Gravwell open-source code to a monorepo: [github.com/gravwell/gravwell](https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell)
* Community Edition licenses will no longer allow the creation of more than 2 users (any existing users will be preserved)
