# Scheduled Searches API

This API allows for the creation and management of scheduled searches. Searches are referred to by a randomly-generated ID.

## Scheduled search structure

A scheduled search contains the following fields of interest:

* ID: the ID of the scheduled search
* GUID: a unique ID for this particular search. If left blank at creation, a random GUID will be assigned (this should be the standard use case)
* Owner: the UID of the search's owner
* Groups: a list of groups which are allowed to see the results of this search
* Global: a boolean indicating that the results of the search should be visible to all users (only admins may set this field)
* Name: the name of this scheduled search
* Description: a textual description of the scheduled search
* Schedule: a cron-compatible string specifying when to run
* Permissions: a 64-bit integer used to store permission bits
* Disabled: a boolean which, if set to true, will prevent the scheduled search from running.
* OneShot: a boolean which, if set to true, will cause the scheduled search to run once as soon as possible, unless disabled.
* LastRun: the time at which this scheduled search last ran
* LastRunDuration: how long the last run took
* LastSearchIDs: an array of strings containing the search IDs of the most recently performed searches from this scheduled search
* LastError: any error resulting from the last run of this search

If the search is a 'standard' scheduled search, it will also set these fields:

* SearchString: the DatalaiQ query to execute
* Duration: a value in seconds specifying how far back to run the search. This must be a negative value.
* SearchSinceLastRun: a boolean. If set, the Duration field will be ignored and the search will instead run from the LastRun time to the present.

If the search is on the other hand a script, it will set the following field:

* Script: a string containing an anko script

## User commands

The API commands in this section can be executed by any user.

### Listing scheduled searches

To get a list of all scheduled searches visible to the user (either owned by the user or marked accessible to one of the user's groups), perform a GET on `/api/scheduledsearches`. The result will look like this:

```
[
  {
    "ID": 1439174790,
    "GUID": "efd1813d-283f-447a-a056-729768326e7b",
    "Groups": null,
	"Global": false,
    "Name": "count",
    "Description": "count all entries",
    "Owner": 1,
    "Schedule": "* * * * *",
    "Permissions": 0,
    "Updated": "2019-05-21T16:01:01.036703243-06:00",
    "Disabled": false,
    "OneShot": false,
    "Synced": true,
    "SearchString": "tag=* count",
    "Duration": -3600,
    "SearchSinceLastRun": false,
    "Script": "",
    "PersistentMaps": {},
    "LastRun": "2019-05-21T16:01:00.013062447-06:00",
    "LastRunDuration": 1015958622,
    "LastSearchIDs": [
      "672586805"
    ],
    "LastError": ""
  }
]

```

This example shows a single scheduled search named "count", owned by UID 1 (admin). It runs every minute and executes the search `tag=* count` over the last hour hours.

### Creating a scheduled search

To create a new scheduled search, perform a POST request on `/api/scheduledsearches` with a JSON structure containing information about the scheduled search. To create a standard search, be sure to populate the SearchString and Duration fields, as in this example which runs a search over the last 24 hours every day at 8 a.m.:

```
{
  "Name": "myscheduledsearch",
  "Description": "a scheduled search",
  "Groups": [
    2
  ],
  "Global": false,
  "Schedule": "0 8 * * *",
  "SearchString": "tag=default grep foo",
  "Duration": -86400,
  "SearchSinceLastRun": false
}

```

Alternately, if the SearchSinceLastRun field is set to true, the search agent will ignore the Duration (except for the first run of this new search) and instead perform the search over the time of the last run to the present time.

To create a scheduled search using a script, populate the "Script" field instead of the "SearchString" and "Duration" fields. If both are populated, the script will take precedence.

A scheduled search may be created with the Disabled flag set to true to prevent it from running until the user is ready. It can also be created with the OneShot flag set to true, which will cause the search to run as soon as possible after creation.

The server will respond with the ID of the new scheduled search.

### Fetching a specific scheduled search

Information about a single scheduled search may be accessed with a GET on `/api/scheduledsearches/{id}`. For example, given a scheduled search ID of 1439174790, we would query `/api/scheduledsearches/1439174790` and receive the following:

```
{
  "ID": 1439174790,
  "GUID": "efd1813d-283f-447a-a056-729768326e7b",
  "Groups": null,
  "Global": false,
  "Name": "count",
  "Description": "count all entries",
  "Owner": 1,
  "Schedule": "* * * * *",
  "Permissions": 0,
  "Updated": "2019-05-21T16:01:01.036703243-06:00",
  "Disabled": false,
  "OneShot": false,
  "Synced": true,
  "SearchString": "tag=* count",
  "Duration": -3600,
  "SearchSinceLastRun": false,
  "Script": "",
  "PersistentMaps": {},
  "LastRun": "2019-05-21T16:01:00.013062447-06:00",
  "LastRunDuration": 1015958622,
  "LastSearchIDs": [
    "672586805"
  ],
  "LastError": ""
}
```

A scheduled search can also be fetched by GUID. Note that this requires more work for the webserver and should only be used when necessary. To fetch the scheduled search shown above, do a GET on `/api/scheduledsearches/cdf011ae-7e60-46ec-827e-9d9fcb0ae66d`.

### Updating an existing search

To modify a scheduled search, do an HTTP PUT to `/api/scheduledsearches/{id}` containing an updated structure with the desired changes. Take care to push the unchanged fields too, or they will be overwritten with empty values.

The following fields can be updated:

* Name
* Description
* Schedule
* SearchString
* Duration
* SearchSinceLastRun
* Script
* Groups
* Global (admin only)
* Disabled
* OneShot

A script scheduled search can be changed to a standard scheduled search by pushing a SearchString and a Duration with the Script field empty. Likewise, a standard scheduled search can be converted to a script scheduled search by pushing a Script field and setting the SearchString empty.

### Clearing a scheduled search error

The LastError field in the scheduled search structure will be set if an error is encountered and will not be cleared by subsequent successful executions. It can be cleared manually by a DELETE on `/api/scheduledsearches/{id}/error`

### Clearing a scheduled search's persistent state

A DELETE on `/api/scheduledsearches/{id}/state` will clear both the LastError field and the persistent maps for the scheduled search. This allows you to reset a scheduled search if the state becomes corrupt due to a bad script.

### Deleting a scheduled search

An existing scheduled search can be removed by performing a DELETE on `/api/scheduledsearches/{id}`.

## Admin commands

The following commands are only available to admin users.

### Listing all searches

Admin users may occasionally need to view all scheduled searches on the system. An administrator user may obtain a global listing of all scheduled searches in the system with a GET request on `/api/scheduledsearches?admin=true`.

Because scheduled search IDs are unique across the system, the administrator may then modify/delete/retrieve any search without the need to specify `?admin=true`, although adding the parameter unnecessarily will not cause an error.

### Fetching a specific user's searches

Performing a GET on `/api/scheduledsearches/user/{uid}`, where `uid` is a numeric user ID, will fetch an array of all searches belonging to that user.

### Deleting all of a specific user's searches

Performing a DELETE on `/api/scheduledsearches/user/{uid}` will delete all scheduled searches belonging to the specified user.

### Running a test parse of a scheduled search

The scheduledsearches API provides an API to test scheduled searches before saving them.  The Parse API is located at `/api/scheduledsearches/parse` and is accessed via a PUT request.  An authenticated user can send a scheduled script to be parsed and checked without saving or modifying an existing scheduled script.

To Perform a parse, send the following JSON structure in the body of a PUT request `/api/scheduledsearches/parse`:

```
{
	Script string
}
```

The API will respond with the following JSON structure:
```
{
	OK bool
	Error string
	ErrorLine int
	ErrorColumn int
}
```

If the script passes the parsing test, the response will contain `true` in the OK field.  The Error field will be omitted and the ErrorLine and ErrorColumn fields will both be `-1`.  If the provided script failed to parse correctly, the OK field will be `false` with the Error field indicating the failure reason and the ErrorLine and ErrorColumn indicating where in the script the error occurred.

The ErrorLine and ErrorColumn fields may not always be populated.  Values of -1 indicate that the script parsing system did not know where in the script the errors are located.

Here is an example request and response:

#### Valid Script
Request
```
{
	"Script":"fmt = import(\"fmt\")\nfmt.Println(\"Hello\")\nfmt.Sstuff(\"Goodbye\")\n"
}
```

Response
```
{
	"OK":true,
	"ErrorLine":-1,
	"ErrorColumn":-1
}
```

#### Invalid Script
Request
```
{
	"Script":"fmt = import(\"fmt\")\nfmt.Println(\"Hello\")\nfmt.Sstuff(\"Goodbye)\n"
}
```

Response
```
{
	"OK":false,
	"Error":"syntax error",
	"ErrorLine":3,
	"ErrorColumn":21
}
```
